            (1) Chicken Riggies
            "Aside from a name that's a hoot to utter, Chicken Riggies (aka Utica, New York’s pasta pride and joy) 
            has a lot more going for it, namely that it's a slightly creamy, spicy, and a bit-sweet pleasure to eat. 
            Its so good, it might just become a new go-to weeknight dinner for you and your family."
            <br><br><br><br>
            (2) Tomato-Butter Roast Chicken
            "Tomato butter works wonders on roast chicken—not only does it keep the bird moist, but the healthy dose of 
            tomato paste brings a slightly sweet, umami acidity to the whole dish. Plus, there are no better 
            veggies than ones that have been roasted underneath a chicken, collecting all of that flavor-packed schmaltz"

        <p> 
          Our menu consists of beef dish. Which is based on mediterranean dish. Beef dishes are often nostalgic. Whether it's a cultural 
          classic like steak frites that will transport you to France, Mom's secret meatloaf recipe, or a hearty stew you grew up with, 
          beef plays a pretty large role in countless cuisines. While you can gussy up the meat with a lavish sauce or seasoning, one factor 
          remains consistent — beef recipes rely on the quality of the cut.
          <br><br><br>
          Beef Tenderlion
          <br>
          Beef tenderloin is an extremely tender piece of meat, and is located in the loin. This is also where filet mignon is located,
          at the very tip of the tenderloin. Because of it being very lean and tender, 
          it's one of the most expensive cuts of meat—but oh, is it worth it for its melt-in-your-mouth taste.
          <br><br><br>
          beef stroganoff
          <br>
          This recipe is paired with the classic extra wide egg noodles, which are incorporated into the sauce so that the noodles 
          can absorb that glossy sauce. That being said, if you’re looking for alternate serving ideas, white rice, some roasted 
          vegetables, or even cauliflower rice (like we do in our keto stroganoff) would all be great ideas.

        <p> 
          We also got suchi which is a elegant japanese taste. Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared 
          with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation 
          crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or 
          pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
