    <h2 style="background-color: maroon"> Beef </h2>
    <p> 
      Our menu consists of beef dish. Which is based on mediterranean dish. Beef dishes are often nostalgic. Whether it's a cultural 
      classic like steak frites that will transport you to France, Mom's secret meatloaf recipe, or a hearty stew you grew up with, 
      beef plays a pretty large role in countless cuisines. While you can gussy up the meat with a lavish sauce or seasoning, one factor 
      remains consistent â€” beef recipes rely on the quality of the cut.

    <p> 
      We also got suchi which is a elegant japanese taste. Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared 
      with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation 
      crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or 
      pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
